**Estimated Cost:** $500 - $15,000 per sponsored video, depending on the influencer's reach and engagement. Associations like the ADA may require partnership or membership fees.

**Expected Reach:** 5,000 - 100,000+ targeted views per video, depending on the channel. Smaller channels offer a highly engaged, niche audience, while larger channels provide broader exposure.

### YouTube Channels for Med Spa Marketing

**Specific Targets:** Boho Med Spa (@BohoMedSpa, 982K subscribers), American Med Spa Association (@AmericanMedSpaAssociation, 3.7K subscribers)

**Contact Method:** Email for direct outreach to influencers, and official contact forms or phone numbers for industry associations to inquire about sponsorship and partnership opportunities.

**Estimated Cost:** $5,000-$25,000 depending on the channel, for sponsored videos, webinars, or content features. Affiliate or partnership models could also be explored.

**Expected Reach:** Varies widely by channel. Larger, consumer-focused channels can offer 100K+ views per video, generating broad brand awareness. Smaller, industry-specific channels offer a more targeted reach of a few thousand professionals, resulting in higher quality leads.

**Best Approach:** The best approach is to engage with both large, consumer-facing channels and smaller, highly-targeted industry channels. For larger channels like Boho Med Spa, a subtle integration or a 'business story' feature would be more effective than a direct sales pitch. For industry-specific channels like the American Med Spa Association, a direct B2B approach through sponsored content, webinars, or partnerships would yield the best results, delivering high-quality leads.

**Timeline:** 2-6 weeks for negotiation, content creation, and scheduling. Results in terms of reach are immediate upon publication, with lead generation occurring over the following weeks.

Other podcasts like 'The Savvy Dentist' and 'The Best Practices Show' have smaller but highly engaged audiences of dental professionals.

**Best Approach:** The best approach is to sponsor a mix of established, high-reach podcasts and smaller, niche podcasts. For high-reach podcasts like 'Dentistry Uncensored,' a pre-roll or mid-roll ad spot would be effective. For smaller, more engaged audiences, a more integrated sponsorship, such as a sponsored segment or interview, would be more impactful. It is also recommended to offer a special deal or discount for the podcast listeners to track the ROI of the campaign.

**Timeline:** Results can be seen within 2-4 weeks of the episode airing, with a long tail of leads coming in over the following months as the episode continues to be downloaded.
