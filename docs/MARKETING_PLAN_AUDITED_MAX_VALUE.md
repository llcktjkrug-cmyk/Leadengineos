# Lead Engine OS - AUDITED Maximum Value Marketing Plan

## Critical Audit of Original Plan

### What I Got Wrong

| Original Allocation | Problem | Reality Check |
|---------------------|---------|---------------|
| LinkedIn Ads $1,000 | Too expensive for early stage | $50-100 CPL, low volume, burns cash fast |
| TikTok Ads $1,500 | Unproven for B2B healthcare | Fun to watch metrics, hard to convert dentists |
| Product Hunt $500 | Wrong audience | Tech founders, not healthcare practice owners |
| BetaList | Wrong audience | Startup enthusiasts, not your buyers |
| Broad influencer mix | Scattered approach | Need laser focus on dental/med spa only |

### The Hard Truth About Your Market

**Your buyers are:**
- Dental practice owners (45-65 years old)
- Med spa owners/managers (35-55 years old)
- NOT on TikTok for business decisions
- NOT browsing Product Hunt
- ARE on Google searching for solutions
- ARE in Facebook Groups asking peers
- ARE reading industry newsletters
- ARE attending conferences (virtually now)

---

## AUDITED PLAN: Maximum Value Extraction

### Month 1: $8,000 - Laser Focused

| Channel | Budget | Why This Works | Expected Customers |
|---------|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Google Ads (Search Only)** | $3,500 | Highest intent buyers actively searching | 8-12 |
| **Facebook/Instagram Ads** | $2,000 | Target dental/med spa owners directly | 6-10 |
| **Industry Micro-Influencers** | $1,500 | Trust from peers they already follow | 5-8 |
| **Cold Email (Apollo/Instantly)** | $500 | Direct outreach to verified practices | 4-8 |
| **Retargeting** | $500 | Convert warm traffic | +3-5 |
| **TOTAL** | **$8,000** | | **26-43 customers** |

### Why This Beats Original Plan

| Metric | Original Plan | Audited Plan | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Expected Customers | 21-40 | 26-43 | +24% |
| Cost Per Customer | $200-380 | $186-308 | -19% |
| Wasted Spend | ~$2,000 | ~$0 | -100% |
| Channel Focus | 6 channels | 4 channels | Better optimization |

---

## Channel Deep Dive: Where Every Dollar Goes

### 1. Google Ads - $3,500 (43.75% of budget)

**Why 43% here:** These are people ACTIVELY SEARCHING for a solution. They have a problem, they want to solve it NOW, and they have budget.

**Exact Campaign Structure:**

| Campaign | Daily Budget | Keywords | Expected CPC |
|----------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| **Dental Marketing** | $50 | "dental practice marketing", "dental seo services", "dental lead generation" | $15-25 |
| **Med Spa Marketing** | $50 | "med spa marketing", "aesthetics practice marketing", "medspa lead generation" | $12-22 |
| **Competitor** | $15 | "podium alternatives", "birdeye competitors", "weave dental alternative" | $8-15 |

**Expected Results:**
- Clicks: 140-230
- Leads: 70-115 (50% conversion rate with strong landing page)
- Customers: 8-12 (10-15% close rate)
- **Cost per customer: $290-$440**

**Optimization Strategy:**
- Week 1: Run all campaigns, collect data
- Week 2: Pause keywords with CPC >$30 and no conversions
- Week 3-4: Double down on winners, add negative keywords

### 2. Facebook/Instagram Ads - $2,000 (25% of budget)

**Why Facebook over TikTok:** Your buyers (45-65 year old practice owners) are on Facebook. They're in groups, they scroll at night, they click on business content.

**Exact Targeting:**

| Audience | Size | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| Job Title: Dentist + Business Owner | 50K-100K | Direct decision makers |
| Job Title: Practice Manager + Healthcare | 100K-200K | Influencers in buying decision |
| Interest: Dental Economics, Dental Town | 200K+ | Industry-engaged |
| Interest: American Med Spa Association | 50K-100K | Your exact market |
| Lookalike: Website visitors | Variable | Warm expansion |

**Ad Creative Strategy:**
- Video testimonial (if available) or founder story
- Carousel showing dashboard/results
- Lead magnet: "2025 Dental Marketing Playbook" or "Med Spa Growth Calculator"

**Expected Results:**
- Impressions: 200,000-400,000
- Clicks: 2,000-4,000
- Leads: 100-200 (5% conversion with lead magnet)
- Customers: 6-10 (5-6% close rate from cold)
- **Cost per customer: $200-$330**

### 3. Industry Micro-Influencers - $1,500 (18.75% of budget)

**Why micro over macro:** A dental consultant with 5K followers who practice owners TRUST will outperform a marketing guru with 500K followers who they don't know.

**Exact Influencers to Contact:**

| Influencer | Platform | Followers | Rate | Why |
|------------|----------|-----------|------|-----|
| **Dr. Anissa Holmes** | Instagram/Podcast | 15K | $500-800 | Dental practice coach, trusted voice |
| **Terri Ross** | LinkedIn/Podcast | 10K | $500-800 | THE med spa consultant |
| **Dental Nachos (Dr. Paul Goodman)** | Facebook/Podcast | 30K | $300-500 | Massive dental community |
| **Aesthetic Record** | Instagram | 20K | $300-500 | Med spa software, overlapping audience |

**Spend Allocation:**
- 2 dental influencers: $800
- 1 med spa influencer: $500
- 1 newsletter/podcast: $200

**Expected Results:**
- Reach: 50,000-80,000 targeted impressions
- Leads: 50-100
- Customers: 5-8
- **Cost per customer: $188-$300**

### 4. Cold Email Outreach - $500 (6.25% of budget)

**Why this is high-ROI:** Direct access to decision makers, highly targeted, scalable.

**Tech Stack:**
- Apollo.io: $99/month (leads database)
- Instantly.ai: $97/month (sending infrastructure)
- Remaining: Email warmup, domains

**Exact Sequence:**

**Email 1 (Day 1):**
```
Subject: Quick question about [Practice Name]'s marketing

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Practice Name] doesn't have much recent content on your blog/social media. 

Are you handling marketing in-house or working with an agency?

We help dental practices generate 20-40 new patient leads/month through automated content marketing. Takes about 10 minutes of your time per week.

Worth a quick call?

[Name]
```

**Email 2 (Day 3):**
```
Subject: Re: Quick question about [Practice Name]'s marketing

[First Name] - wanted to bump this up.

Here's what we did for [Similar Practice]:
- 47 new patient inquiries in 30 days
- 12 hours/month saved on marketing
- $0 spent on ads

Want me to show you how?

[Name]
```

**Email 3 (Day 7):**
```
Subject: Last try

[First Name],

I'll keep this short - if you're not interested in growing [Practice Name] through content marketing, no worries.

But if you want to see how practices like yours are getting 30+ leads/month without hiring a marketing team, here's a 2-min video: [Link]

Either way, good luck with the practice.

[Name]
```

**Expected Results:**
- Emails sent: 3,000-5,000
- Open rate: 40-50%
- Reply rate: 3-5%
- Meetings booked: 30-50
- Customers: 4-8
- **Cost per customer: $62-$125** ← BEST ROI CHANNEL

### 5. Retargeting - $500 (6.25% of budget)

**Why essential:** 97% of visitors don't convert on first visit. Retargeting brings them back.

**Platforms:**
- Google Display: $250
- Meta (FB/IG): $250

**Audiences:**
- Website visitors (all pages)
- Pricing page visitors (high intent)
- Blog readers
- Video viewers (50%+)

**Expected Results:**
- Additional conversions: 3-5 customers
- **Cost per customer: $100-$167**
