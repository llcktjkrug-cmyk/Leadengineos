**Email 1: (Day 1)**

Subject: Quick question about {{company}}'s marketing

Body:
```
Hi {{firstName}},

I noticed {{company}} doesn't have much recent content on your website or social media.

Are you handling marketing in-house or working with an agency?

We help dental practices generate 20-40 new patient leads/month through automated content marketing. Takes about 10 minutes of your time per week.

Worth a quick call?

Best,
[Your Name]
Lead Engine OS
```

**Email 2: (Day 4 - if no reply)**

Subject: Re: Quick question about {{company}}'s marketing

Body:
```
{{firstName}} - wanted to bump this up.

Here's what we did for a practice similar to {{company}}:
• 47 new patient inquiries in 30 days
• 12 hours/month saved on marketing
• $0 spent on ads

Want me to show you how?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Email 3: (Day 7 - if no reply)**

Subject: Last try

Body:
```
{{firstName}},

I'll keep this short - if you're not interested in growing {{company}} through content marketing, no worries.

But if you want to see how practices like yours are getting 30+ leads/month without hiring a marketing team, here's a 2-min video: https://leadengineosapp.com/demo

Either way, good luck with the practice.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**STEP 9: Set Up Campaign for Med Spas**

Repeat Step 8 with med spa list, replacing "dental practice" with "med spa"

**STEP 10: Launch Campaigns (After Warmup Complete)**

1. After 2-3 weeks of warmup
2. Start sending:
   - 50 emails/day per domain
   - 3 domains = 150 emails/day total
   - 5,000 dental + 3,000 med spa = 8,000 total
   - Will take ~53 days to complete
3. Monitor replies daily
4. Respond to interested leads within 5 minutes

**STEP 11: Track Results**

Create spreadsheet tracking:
- Emails sent
- Open rate (target: 40-60%)
- Reply rate (target: 3-5%)
- Positive replies
- Meetings booked
- Customers acquired

## CAMPAIGN 5: PRESS RELEASE ($500)

### STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION

**STEP 1: Write Press Release**

**Headline:**
DIS OPTIMUS CAPITAL LLC Launches Lead Engine OS: AI-Powered Content Marketing Automation for Healthcare Practices

**Subheadline:**
New SaaS Platform Helps Dental Practices and Med Spas Generate 20-40 Leads Per Month Through Automated Content Marketing

**Date:** [Launch Date]

**Location:** San Juan, Puerto Rico

**Body:**

DIS OPTIMUS CAPITAL LLC today announced the launch of Lead Engine OS, an AI-powered content marketing automation platform designed specifically for dental practices and medical spas.

Lead Engine OS addresses a critical challenge facing healthcare practice owners: the need for consistent, effective marketing without the high costs of traditional agencies or the time investment of doing it themselves.

"Practice owners are incredibly busy caring for patients," said Jamar Johnson, Founder of DIS OPTIMUS CAPITAL LLC. "They know they need marketing to grow, but they don't have 10-20 hours per week to create content, manage social media, and optimize SEO. Lead Engine OS automates all of that for a fraction of the cost of hiring an agency."

The platform uses artificial intelligence to:
• Generate SEO-optimized blog posts and articles
• Create and schedule social media content
• Automate email marketing campaigns
• Track and analyze lead generation metrics
• Integrate with existing practice management software

Early adopters are seeing significant results. One dental practice generated 47 new patient inquiries in the first 30 days, while saving 12 hours per month on marketing tasks.

Lead Engine OS offers three pricing tiers starting at $297 per month, with no long-term contracts required. A 14-day free trial is available at leadengineosapp.com.

"We're not trying to replace the human touch in healthcare marketing," Johnson added. "We're giving practice owners their time back while ensuring their marketing runs on autopilot. It's the best of both worlds."
