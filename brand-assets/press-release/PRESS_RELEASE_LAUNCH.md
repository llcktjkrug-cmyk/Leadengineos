## Lead Engine OS Launches AI-Powered Marketing Fulfillment Platform for Service Businesses

*New SaaS platform automates content creation and delivery for home services, legal, and healthcare operators*

---

**SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO — December 2024** — Lead Engine OS, a product of DIS OPTIMUS CAPITAL LLC, today announced the launch of its AI-powered marketing fulfillment platform designed specifically for service-based businesses. The platform enables operators in home services, legal, and healthcare verticals to automate their content marketing operations without hiring additional staff.

### The Problem

Service business operators face a persistent challenge: they need consistent, high-quality marketing content to attract customers, but lack the time, expertise, or budget to produce it themselves. Traditional agencies are expensive and slow. Freelancers are unreliable. DIY tools require skills most operators don't have.

### The Solution

Lead Engine OS provides a complete marketing fulfillment system that runs itself. Operators simply submit requests through an intuitive portal, and the platform handles everything from content creation to WordPress publishing.

**Key capabilities include:**

- **Blog articles and SEO content** optimized for local search
- **Service pages and landing pages** that convert visitors to leads
- **Google Business Profile posts** to maintain local presence
- **Social media content** for consistent brand visibility
- **Direct WordPress integration** for hands-free publishing

### How It Works

1. Operators subscribe to a monthly plan based on their content needs
2. They submit requests through the Lead Engine OS portal
3. AI-powered workflows generate professional content
4. Content is delivered directly to their WordPress site or content library
5. Operators review, approve, and publish with one click

### Pricing

Lead Engine OS offers three subscription tiers:

| Plan | Monthly Price | Blog Posts | Service Pages | GMB Posts |
|------|---------------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| Starter | $297/month | 4 | 2 | 8 |
| Pro | $597/month | 8 | 4 | 16 |
| Scale | $997/month | 16 | 8 | 30 |

All plans include WordPress integration, content library access, and priority support.
